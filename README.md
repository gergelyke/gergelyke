### Hi, I am Gergely ðŸ‘‹

**I am an engineering manager and conference speaker. Coffee lover.**

I previously led multiple teams and projects as part of the Developer Platform organization at Uber, focusing on the web ([Base Web](https://baseweb.design/), [Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/) or [Styletron](https://www.styletron.org/)), open-source, and the company-wide CI solution.

Even before that, I built [RisingStack](https://risingstack.com), [JSConf Budapest](https://jsconfbp.com) & the [GoDaddy Open Source Center](https://godaddy.github.io).

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/gergelyke), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nthgergo), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nthgergo), DMs are open!
